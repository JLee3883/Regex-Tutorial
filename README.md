# 17 Computer Science for JavaScript: Regex Tutorial

## Your Task

Developers write code, but they also *write about code*. Take a moment to search the web for tutorials about any of the subjects you’ve learned so far in this course. You’re likely to find thousands of tutorials written by developers of all skill levels, including junior developers&mdash;like yourself!

Your assignment this week is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. You'll use the template provided in the starter code to create your walkthrough.

## User Story
